I am an associate professor in the School of Atmospheric Sciences at the Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, China. I study the surface impacts of the stratosphere.

Recently, I have been working on diagnosing the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation signal at the surface using trace gases. I look into observations of the tracer and put it in a model to represent its atmospheric transport. I am also interested in the climate impacts of large volcanic eruptions, like the recent 2022 January Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption.

I teach an undergraduate course, Stratospheric Processes and Their Climate Impacts, and an undergraduate course, Statistics in Meteorology.

I supervise 8 3-yr MS students, including Yangjie Jiang (3rd year), Zejie Tian (3rd year), Wenhui Zhang (2nd year), Guiping Zhang (2nd year), Liting Jia (2nd year), Haoran Zhou (1st year), Jie Jin (1st year), and Ruihan Gao (1st year).
