Around 150 Tg (150 million tons) of water vapor was injected into the stratosphere during the eruption of Hunga Tonga‚ÄêHunga Ha'apai. Water vapor is a greenhouse gas and this increase is expected to have a warming effect in the troposphere, as well causing perturbations in stratospheric chemistry and aerosols. We use an atmospheric model to study the residence time of this excess water vapor and its impact on the recent Antarctic ozone hole.
