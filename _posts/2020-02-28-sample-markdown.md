Recently, I have been working on diagnosing the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation signal at the surface using trace gases. I look into observations of the tracer and put it in a model to represent its atmospheric transport.

I am also interested in the climate impacts of large volcanic eruptions, like the recent 2022 January Hunga Tonga–Hunga Haʻapai eruption.

I teach an undergraduate course, Stratospheric Processes and Their Climate Impacts, and an undergraduate course, Statistics in Meteorology.
